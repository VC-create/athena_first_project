1. What your project is/does (and what it's called)
    My project is a website I made for the FIFA World Cup 2026. It's just to give some information about it and 
    make people excited! It's called the World Cup 2026.
2. Why you made your project
    I made this project because I am a beginner so decided to start with a website. I chose this topic because it was 
    something that interested me and I knew I wouldn't get bored. I hope that people can look at it and get information
    but also feel excited and get hyped! Additonally, I know that I will keep coming back and making changes so it is 
    nice to have an ongoing project that I can improve on. For example I want to add some more backend and more 
    interactivity in the future.
3. How you made your project
    I made my project using Github codespaces. It was very easy to use, however I had a few issues getting wakatime to work. Once I started however, it was fun. I just had to make sure to remember to commit my changes. I used HTML and 
    CSS and one JS function to do this. 
4. What you struggled with and what you learned
    I struggled with getting wakatime to work since it was giving me errors. After some troubleshooting and help, I finally got it to work. Some of my changes weren't showing up when I made my website, so for some reason I had to rename the files I made so it would work. Also I had to keep clearing my browser data and cache for the changes to show up. I learned how to make a navbar and flipcards. I had to watch a lot of Youtube videos and read a lot of W3 schools to understand how the code worked and do it myself. I am most proud of the players pages since I worked very hard on those to type up all that information, and additonally on the flipcards to work in the table. In the future I want to expand on this website with express and add backend and cool new interactive feautures, like polls that users can do and more.
